# AOC2022

Attempting [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) while waiting for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Initial plans were to do AOC2022 in a language I know well, and then do it in two languages I want to learn to accelerate the learning process.

I've since abandoned this because I ran out of time prior to AOC2023 starting and I am trying to prioritise C++. Upon completion of AOC2023, I may return and redo all challenges in C# and Swift.


## Known language; C#

I wasn't aware how much plumbing was required to simply create a DLL for utility functionality, and I've thoroughly enjoyed learning how it all works which is why AOC2023 will be focused upon C++.
